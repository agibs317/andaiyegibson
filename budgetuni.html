    <p>When our group first chose this prompt, we began by listing all the possible and necessary features that came to mind. These ideas were then organized by similarity.</p>

    <h2>User Research and User Persona</h2>
    <div class="container-1">
        <div><p>Our group conducted 20-minute interviews in person or over Zoom, with one interviewer and one moderator. Participants consisted of University of Miami students, family, and friends all ages 19-30.</p>
            <br>
        <p>
            <strong>The Interviews yielded the following insights and recommendations.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Financial literacy lessons/modules/tips should be <span>short</span> in length
            </li>
            <li>Sharing feature should be <span>limited</span> to only setting budget goals with friends and family and allowing family to only view or follow spending log
            </li>
            <li><span>Notifications</span> are the most effective way to remind users of due dates (bill reminders)</li>
            <li>The <span>more visuals</span> the better</li>

            <p><strong>Imani</strong> is a college student who is tired of paying for Ubers every time she goes out. She needs a platform that helps her divide her income so she knows where to cut back and can allocate that money into a savings for a new car.</p>

        <h2>Designing</h2>
        <p>With all of the features our group had in mind we developed an annotated site map. The user flow is a snapshot of the larger site map, specifically focusing on the needs of the user persona that was created.</p>

    <p>Using the user flow our group created wireframes to reflect the process of going through the app. </p>

    <p>As the UX design process progressed, our group settled on a clean typeface and a color scheme that was closely associated with finance and piggy banks.</p>

                    <ul>
                <li><span>Hide</span> spending log on the dashboard or create a button that links to a separate page</li>
                <li>Signify <span>optional</span> input fields such as adding an initial amount to a savings goal when first creating it</li>
                <li>Saving goal <span>view</span> should display the goal amount and end date</li>
                <li>Have a user onboarding <span>tutorial</span> for first-time users</li>
                <li>Add text to the search bar to increase <span>affordance</span> as well as make the help icon more obvious that it is for budgeting tips</li>
                <li>Add <span>description</span> or memo field about the goal to keep track of its information</li>
                <li>Add <span>category</span> tags in the spending log in overall history</li>
